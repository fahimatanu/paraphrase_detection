# paraphrase_detection
This project implements a paraphrased plagiarism detection system by leveraging sentence embeddings and dual similarity metrics to compare a student’s submission against source documents. The process begins with reading both submission and source texts, which are then tokenized into sentences using NLTK’s sent_tokenize() function. Each sentence is encoded into a dense vector representation using the pre-trained all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Sentence-BERT via the SentenceTransformer library, capturing semantic context beyond lexical form. To quantify similarity, the system computes cosine similarity between all pairs of submission and source sentence embeddings using sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity, identifying semantically close pairs. Simultaneously, it computes Jaccard similarity at the word level by treating each sentence as a set of lowercased tokens, measuring lexical overlap. Sentence pairs with cosine similarity above a configurable threshold (e.g., 0.70) and Jaccard similarity below another threshold (e.g., 0.35) are flagged as likely paraphrases. These flagged pairs are printed with their similarity scores for manual inspection, enabling an effective method to detect meaning-preserving but reworded plagiarism.
