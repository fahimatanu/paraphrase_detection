# paraphrase_detection
This project implements a system to detect paraphrased plagiarism by comparing a studentâ€™s submission against known source documents using sentence embeddings and similarity metrics. The workflow begins by loading both the submission and source texts, then segmenting them into individual sentences. These sentences are transformed into dense numerical vectors using a pre-trained Sentence-BERT model, which captures their semantic meaning. To identify potential paraphrases, the system calculates cosine similarity to measure semantic closeness and Jaccard similarity to assess lexical overlap. Sentence pairs with high semantic similarity but low lexical similarity are flagged as potential paraphrased plagiarism candidates. These flagged pairs can then be reviewed manually to determine the likelihood of plagiarism, providing a balanced and interpretable approach to detecting reworded content with retained meaning.
